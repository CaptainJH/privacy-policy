                <h4>Personal Data</h4>
                <p>While using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify You. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usage Data</li>

                <h4>Microphone and Device Audio Data</h4>
                <p>To provide comprehensive real-time voice transcription features, Our Application requires access to capture audio from Your Device. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Microphone Data:</strong> We access Your microphone to capture external speech and sounds.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Audio Data:</strong> We access Your device's internal audio output to transcribe audio playing on Your device (e.g., from online meetings or media). We utilize secure, native operating system capabilities to capture this audio safely and efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We collect and process this audio data <strong>only</strong> when You explicitly activate the recording or transcription feature. A visual indicator (such as a system status bar icon) will always appear when audio is being recorded.</p>
                <p>Depending on Your device settings and the technology used (e.g., Apple's Speech Framework), this audio data may be processed locally on Your Device or transmitted securely to a third-party speech recognition provider solely for conversion into text. This audio data is not retained by Us after the transcription is complete.</p>
