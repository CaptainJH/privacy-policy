                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [December 29, 2025]</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use this iOS application (the "App"). This policy is designed to accurately reflect the App's current and reasonably anticipated data practices.</p>
                
                <hr>

                <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal data that can be used to identify users.</p>
                <p>The App is designed to function without user accounts, registration, or personal information. We do not operate backend services that collect user-generated content or personal identifiers.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>2. Diagnostic and Crash Information</h2>
                <p>To improve the stability, reliability, and performance of the App, the App <strong>may collect limited diagnostic information</strong>, such as crash reports or error logs.</p>
                <p>This diagnostic information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> include personal data</li>
                    <li>Is collected in an aggregated and/or anonymized form</li>
                    <li>Is used solely for identifying and fixing technical issues</li>
                    <li>Is <strong>not</strong> used for advertising, analytics profiling, or tracking purposes</li>
                    <li>Is <strong>not</strong> linked to a user's identity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Diagnostic data may be processed using system-provided tools or third-party crash reporting services strictly for the purposes described above.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>3. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
                <p>Aside from the limited diagnostic data described above, the App does <strong>not</strong> automatically collect any information, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device identifiers used for tracking</li>
                    <li>Precise location data</li>
                    <li>Usage behavior analytics</li>
                    <li>Cookies or cross-app tracking technologies</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
                <p>The App is free to download and offers a one-time, non-subscription in-app purchase.</p>
                <p>All payments are processed exclusively by Apple through the App Store. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or have access to any payment information, billing details, or transaction data. Apple's handling of payment information is governed by Apple's own privacy policy.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The App does not use third-party services for advertising or user tracking.</p>
                <p>If third-party services are used for crash reporting or diagnostics, they are limited to technical error monitoring purposes and are not permitted to use the data for their own advertising or tracking.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Diagnostic information, if collected, is retained only for as long as necessary to analyze and resolve technical issues, after which it is deleted or anonymized in accordance with applicable policies.</p>
                <p>No personal data is retained because no personal data is collected.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Any diagnostic information collected does not identify users and cannot be used to determine a user's age or identity.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements or App functionality. Any changes will be indicated by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

                <hr>
